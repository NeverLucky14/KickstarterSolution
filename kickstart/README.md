# KickstarterSolution
KickStarter has a issue with trust has people who donate are not sure if the person behind the project is actually going to use the money donated as they presented.

With this implementation with eliminate the need for trust in this scenario as every single transaction made with donated money will need to be approved by the donators , so governance is implemented,
and there is no centralized party has Kickstarter is.

To run the project -> npm run dev
